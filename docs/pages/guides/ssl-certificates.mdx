title: SSL Certificates for TLS
sidebar_label: TLS / SSL Cerficates
---

To enable TLS, you need an SSL certificate. When setting this option, the component chart will add an annotation to your ingress which tells cert-manager to privision an SSL certificate for all the hosts in this ingress.

```yaml {7}
containers:
- image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
service:
  ports:
  - port: 3000
ingress:
  tls: true
  rules:
  - host: my-static-host.tld
  - host: other-domain.tld
    path: /login
```

:::warning
Using `tls: true` requires that your Kubernetes cluster has cert-manager installed. If do not want to use cert-manager, you can (instead of using `true` as a value) provide the name of a secret continaing your TLS certificate instead, e.g. `tls: my-tls-secret`.
:::

## Check Certificate Status
To check the status of all your SSL certificates (and see if cert-manager has already provisioned them via Letsencrypt), run the following command:
```bash
kubectl get certificate
```
